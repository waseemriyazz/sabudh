Add “a” and “d” element-wise to create a new Numpy array “e”.
Multiply “b” by 2 to create a new Numpy array “b_double”.
Calculate the dot product of “b” and “b_double” to create a new Numpy array “f”.
Calculate the mean of “a”,” b”, and “b_double” to create a new Numpy array “g”.
 

4: Numpy array aggregation
